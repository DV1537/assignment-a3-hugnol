Because of time pressure i made the program only able to add points to a polygon where the first object input is a polygon.

What i could have done differently. (Personal Notes, no require to read)
 
 - Taken more time on planning my class structure before taking the problem head on.
 - Could've tested triangle method for area of a polygon.
 - Find my problems with more precision, looking them upp etc. before beginning to question teachers about them.
